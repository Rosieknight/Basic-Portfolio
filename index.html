		<p>Hi, my name is Laura. I have a Bachelor's from UCF in History, and an AA in Business from SSC. I currently work in retail. At this point in my life, I am more than ready for a change in careers.</p>
		<p>I'm a <em>Star Wars</em> fan, though my relationship with the later books is complicated. I love to read, espeically mysteries, fantasy, and science fiction. I don't have a consistant favorite book. It tends to vary based on my mood and current reading habits. There are a handful of books and stories I will consistantly reccomend,  if asked. I enjoy a wide variety of music, ranging from bands like the Beatles or Led Zepplin to movie scores and soundtracks. There are a handful of songs that I consider my favorite, though these are also subject to change with mood and current listening preferences.</p>
