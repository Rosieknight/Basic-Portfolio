<h2>About me</h2>
	<img src=""> <!--I do have a recent picture of myself looking professional. However, it was taken after a funeral and I'm not yet at the point in the grieving process where I can look at the photo with anything other than pain.-->
	<p>Hi, my name is Laura. I am a thirty four year old <em>Star Wars</em> fan. I love to read, espeically mysteries, fantasy, and science fiction. I don't have a consistant favorite book. It tends to vary based on my mood and current reading habits. There are a handful of books and stories I will consistantly reccomend,  if asked.</p>
	<p>I enjoy a wide variety of music, ranging from bands like the Beatles or Led Zepplin to movie scores and soundtracks.</p>
